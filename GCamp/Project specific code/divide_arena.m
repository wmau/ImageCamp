function [grid_binary, grid_sum] = divide_arena( TMap, num_grids, num_grids2 )
% arena_map_binary = divide_arena( TMap, num_grids )
%   Takes the grid from TMap and divides it up into a num_grids x num_grids
%   Alternatively, if the syntax ..., num_grids, num_grids2) is used, you
%   will get num_grids x num_grids2.  Spits out a cell grid_binary
%   where each entry is the same size as TMap with ones in the appropriate
%   grid.  grid_sum is the sum of values in each of the grids.
%   If no num_grids is specified, it will default to 3.  Uses MATLAB syntax
%   for rows/columns (e.g. num_grids = 3 and num_grids2 = 4 gives you a 3
%   row x 4 column grid)

% Pull out number of grids in each direction
