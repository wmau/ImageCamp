%
%   pval1, pval2: arrays of p-values (low value = high spatial information)
%   for each session
%

%   index in pval2

%   filter_spec: 
%   1 = take neurons from both sessions that pass filter applied
%   to session 1 only
%   1 = same as 1 but for session 2
%   3 = take neurons that pass filter for BOTH session only (default)
%   4 = take neurons that pass filter for EITHER session
%
%   thresh: p-value thresh - only keep p-value less than this.  Default = 0.05.
